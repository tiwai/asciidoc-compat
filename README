ASCIIDOC COMPATIBLE WRAPPER SCRIPTS
===================================

This package provides wrapper scripts for asciidoc and a2x using
asciidoctor and xmlto instead.  The scripts are written in bash, and
support only the very limited features.

As the main purpose of the package is to make the other existing
package building mostly as is, and *not* for providing the full
compatibility with all asciidoc features.  Hence many options are
silently ignored.
